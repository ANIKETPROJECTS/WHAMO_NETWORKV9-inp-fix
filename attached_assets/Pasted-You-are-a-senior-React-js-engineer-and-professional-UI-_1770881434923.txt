You are a senior React.js engineer and professional UI/UX designer
experienced in building desktop-style engineering software
(WHAMO / hydraulic analysis / CAD-like tools).

TASK:
Modify my existing React (Vite) project UI so that
"New Project" and "Open Project" are shown directly
inside the main white canvas area — NOT in a popup,
NOT as a separate page — while keeping the header,
menu bar, and all other components visible.

--------------------------------
GLOBAL RULES (STRICT)
--------------------------------
- DO NOT use modal dialogs or popups
- DO NOT hide or replace the header
- DO NOT navigate to a new page
- Everything must happen inside the existing editor layout
- UI must feel like desktop engineering software

--------------------------------
LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------

1) HEADER (UNCHANGED)
- Keep existing header exactly as-is:
  - Project name ("Untitled Network")
  - Menu bar (File, Edit, View, Insert, Tools, Help)
  - Title: "Hydraulic transient analysis software"
  - Buttons: "Generate .INP", "Generate .OUT"

2) MAIN CANVAS (WHITE SCREEN)
- White background
- Light dotted grid
- Full width and height
- Scrollable and zoomable
- Always visible

--------------------------------
NEW / OPEN PROJECT UI (IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------

Show two large cards INSIDE the canvas area
at the center positions marked in the uploaded image
(left-center and right-center of the canvas).

Card 1: New Project
- Icon: plus (+)
- Title: "New Project"
- Subtitle:
  "Start a new hydraulic network analysis project from scratch"

Card 2: Open Project
- Icon: document/file
- Title: "Open Project"
- Subtitle:
  "Continue working on an existing project or import files"

Design:
- White cards
- Rounded corners
- Soft shadow
- Blue icon background
- Professional spacing
- Same visual style as WHAMO Analysis screen

--------------------------------
BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL)
--------------------------------

- Cards are rendered ONLY when:
  projectState === "empty"

- Clicking "New Project":
  - Clears canvas
  - Initializes empty network
  - Hides both cards
  - Keeps user in the same canvas

- Clicking "Open Project":
  - Loads mock project data
  - Hides both cards
  - Keeps user in the same canvas

- NO popup
- NO modal
- NO page navigation

--------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
--------------------------------

- Use a simple React state:
  const [projectState, setProjectState] = useState("empty");

States:
- "empty" → show New/Open cards inside canvas
- "active" → show canvas only

- Cards should be absolutely positioned
  relative to the canvas container
  (not the full page)

--------------------------------
STYLING RULES
--------------------------------
- Background: pure white
- Grid: subtle dotted pattern
- Primary color: dark blue
- Accent color: light blue
- No gradients
- No animations beyond hover
- Clean, government-grade look

--------------------------------
FINAL RESULT
--------------------------------
The final UI should look like a professional
WHAMO-style hydraulic analysis desktop application:

- Header always visible
- White engineering canvas always visible
- New/Open Project cards shown inside canvas
- No popups, no modals, no page changes
- Exactly matching the uploaded screenshots and marked positions

Apply changes cleanly without breaking existing functionality.
